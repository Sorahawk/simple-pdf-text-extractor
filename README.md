# Simple PDF Text Extractor

Place PDF files in Input folder and it will generate corresponding text files in Output folder.

Works on PDF files which have digitally-recognisable text, but still might not be entirely accurate.
Refer to [Advanced PDF Text Extractor](https://github.com/Sorahawk/advanced-pdf-text-extractor) for more accurate text extraction using OCR.

Requires PyPDF4 as a dependency.
